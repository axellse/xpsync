# xpsync
a windows xp style app for transferring files between two devices over a local network, made for hack club's [rewind](https://rewind.hackclub.com/) event.
## background
i have a problem whenever i try to move files between my phone and my computer. I usually just dump the files in a random discord channel and download them on the other device, but this is slow, limited to 25mb, and i dont want my files on a random discord server. Im not going to sign up for some stupid cloud bs and im not finding a lightning cable and connecting to my phone over itunes like its 2008.

xpsync solves all of these problems: it's extremly fast and privacy respecting since files never leave your local network, and theres of course no file limit. You can transfer files from and to everything with a web browser (smart fridge included).
## getting started
